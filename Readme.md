The file Bank.xls contains data on 5000 customers. The data include customer
demographic information (age, income, etc.), the customer's relationship with the bank
(mortgage, securities account, etc.), and the customer response to the last personal
loan campaign (Personal Loan).
Among these 5000 customers, only 480 (= 9.6%) accepted the personal loan that was
offered to them in the earlier campaign.

The bank has a growing customer base. The bank wants to increase borrowers (asset
customers) base to bring in more loan business and earn more through the interest on
loans. So , the bank wants to convert the liability based customers to personal loan
customers. (while retaining them as depositors). A campaign that the bank ran last year
for liability customers showed a healthy conversion rate of over 9% success. The
department wants you to build a model that will help them identify the potential
customers who have a higher probability of purchasing the loan. This will increase the
success ratio while at the same time reduce the cost of the campaign.
